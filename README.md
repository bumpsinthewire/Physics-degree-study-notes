# ASU Physics Degree Study Notes

My comprehensive journey through Arizona State University's online BS in Physics program, with a minor in Data Science and Certificate in Mathematical Concepts of Engineering.

This vault contains study notes, assignments, labs, and projects organized by class. Each major class has its own folder with a landing page (README) that provides an overview and links to detailed notes and projects.

## Classes

- [Physics](./Physics/) - Core physics coursework and concepts
- [Data-Science](./Data-Science/) - Data science minor classes and projects
- [Math-Engineering](./Math-Engineering/) - Mathematical concepts for engineering certificate

## Projects

- [Projects](./Projects/) - Overarching projects and portfolio pieces that span multiple classes

## How This Works

Each class follows this structure:
- **README.md**: Landing page with overview, syllabus links, and progress
- **Study notes**: Detailed technical notes from lectures and labs
- **Assignments/Projects**: Individual work and group projects

All content is version controlled and synced across my devices via iCloud and Git.
